# Star Flight Simulator

## Overview
Star Flight Simulator is a 3D browser-based game built with Three.js that allows players to pilot a spacecraft through an immersive space environment. The game features Minecraft-style voxel graphics to ensure optimal performance while maintaining an engaging visual experience. Players can explore a vast universe, visit different planets, engage with space objects, and battle alien ships.

## Game Features
- **Space Exploration**: Navigate through a vast universe filled with stars, planets, and satellites
- **Multiple Planets**: Visit and explore uniquely designed planets with different characteristics
- **Combat System**: Engage in battles with alien ships using the spacecraft's weapons
- **Minecraft-Inspired Graphics**: Voxel-based visuals that are both performant and visually appealing
- **Interactive Environment**: Interact with satellites, asteroids, and other space objects
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Experience realistic space lighting effects
- **Physics-Based Flight**: Realistic but accessible flight mechanics

## Technical Stack
- **Three.js**: Core 3D rendering library
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Primary programming languages
- **WebGL**: Hardware-accelerated graphics rendering
- **Cannon.js/Ammo.js**: Physics engine for realistic flight mechanics
- **Howler.js**: Audio management
- **Webpack/Vite**: Build and bundling tools

- Complete missions and objectives tied to specific locations

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or yarn

### Installation Steps
```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/star-flight-simulator.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd star-flight-simulator

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

```
npm run build
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Structure
- `/src`: Source code
  - `/components`: Reusable game components
  - `/systems`: Core game systems (physics, rendering, etc.)
  - `/assets`: Game assets (models, textures, audio)
  - `/utils`: Utility functions
  - `/scenes`: Game scenes and levels
  - `/entities`: Game entity definitions

### Coding Standards
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow object-oriented design patterns
- Document all public methods and classes
- Write unit tests for critical systems
- Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize 3D models to maintain the voxel style while minimizing polygon count
- Implement object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
- Use level-of-detail techniques for distant objects
- Optimize render calls and batching
- Use efficient collision detection algorithms

## Future Enhancements
- Multiplayer mode
- Additional planet types and environments
- Enhanced AI for more challenging gameplay
- Mission/quest system
- Spacecraft customization
- Mobile device support
- VR compatibility
